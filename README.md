# EEE-Summer-Project-2020
Place where we are going to share our work and progress.

-remember to mainly commit the .asc files  + record the the testing if the single blocks for final report

Meeting 22/05/2020

We discussed and divided the basic single block diagrams that build up the synthesizer: 
- the controller keyboard and how it interfaces with the oscillator                         ---- SELIN
- the LFO (low frequencies oscillator)                                                      ---- SELIN  
- the VCO (voltage conttrolled oscillator)                                                  ---- MIA
- the filter envelope generator (it determines the "instrument sound")                      ----MARGHE
- filters that we can add later to create sound effects                                     ----MARGHE
- the amplifier (aka power amplifier because we need to a drive high current in the speaker)----SAM

We need to understand/clarify:
- what type of waveforms we want to generate
- how the waveform shape determines the instrument and the frequency
- on how many octaves we want to produce sounds as this determines the number of oscillators --->> use of the exponential converter for more than one octave
- how the LFO connects to the oscillator
